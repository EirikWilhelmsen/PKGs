# Repository for Bachelor thesis

Branch out to a premade demo branch and download requirements.txt to run the program correctly. Etter at PKG API'en provided by the IAI group is started in the background. Navigate to PKGs in the terminal and type Python app.py. From there, the index is opened on localhost 7000. 

Note that the Spotify API is unavailable unless a request is sent to Eirik with a Spotify email, and he adds you.
